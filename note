Error1:if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST")
$_SERVER means  currently executing script,so can't use this to check method in another file
Error2:Undefined index with $_POST [registeration[username]]
<input type="text" name="registeration[username]" id="regist_username" placeholder="E-mail">
it's due to $_POST array doesn't find the element with index registeration[username]
--->remove ssymbols[]

	
			//print_r(array_key_exists("loggedin", $_SESSION));
			//foreach ($_SESSION as $value) {
				//echo "$value <br>";
			//}
